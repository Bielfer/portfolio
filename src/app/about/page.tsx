    'When I first heard about uber, in 2015, I got amazed. People now could ask a "cab" from anyone, anywhere, at anytime through their mobile phones. That moment I was decided to create my own app. At that moment I had never heard about programming before, but I was decided to have my own app.',
    "Fast forward a few years, I decided to pursue my dream to build an app, by enrolling in Electrical Engineering at the University of SÃ£o Paulo, the best college in Brazil. The first time I was tasked to build a program in C, oh boy, it amazed me, and I was sure what I was gonna do for a living.",
    "After deciding what career I was gonna pursue, there was only one more thing that I had to fix, my health. At the beginning of 2023 after being sick for over a month, and a series of misdiagnoses later, a discovery was made, Crohn's disease. Without getting into the medical jargon, this disease basically restricts my ability to consume junk food, which I used to eat, a lot.",
    "After 2 weeks in hospital and a month of resting, I had to change my life. Since June 2023 I've been working out every day, besides sunday (no rest, no growth). 30 kgs, or 67 lbs, later, I can confidently say I'm living in my best self, as a healthy programmer.",
